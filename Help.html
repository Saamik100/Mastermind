<p id="Info"> You can choose one player or two player. In one player the computer generates a random code that you try guessing. You input colors in an order to guess. The computer will put white and red pegs. A white peg means you had a correct color but it was in the wrong spot. A red peg means you had a correct color in the right spot. You will not know which color the peg is reffering to. If you are able to get the answer in 10 or less guesses you win. If not the computer wins. In two player the first player chooses their code and then the second player tries to guess. The red and white pegs mean the same things and will be put automatically after the guess is submitted. If the second player gets the code in less than ten guesses they win. If they fail the first player wins. You can also play twice swapping roles and see who gets it in less guesses. Clicking back in the middle of a game will reset your progress. Two of the same colors can't be in the same code but you can guess two of the same colors in the same code for strategy.  </p>
